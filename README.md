# Pancard-tampering-detection
The purpose of this project is to detect tampering/fraud of PAN cards using computer vision. This project will help the different organizations in detecting whether the Id i.e. the PAN card provided to them by their employees or customers or anyone is original or not.
For this project we will calculate the structural similarity of the original PAN card and the PAN card uploaded by the user.
Similarly in this project with the help of image processing involving the techniques of computer vision we are going to detect that whether the given image of the PAN card is original or tampered (fake) PAN card.
